====================================================


How to update your old Delphi code
----------------------------------

1. Remove _all_ of the old components from 
   your project's forms, since there is no 
   longer a TDocumentObjectModel component 
   and the remaining TXmlToDomParser component 
   lost its DocObjMod property.
2. Save your now incomplete projects.
3. Uninstall the old components as described
   below.
4. Install the components from 'XDOM.pas' as
   described in 'readme.html'.
5. Reload your projects and put the new 
   components on its forms where necessary.
6. Adjust your source code. A list of modified
   classes and methods can be found in the
   file 'history.txt'. For a detailed 
   documentation of all classes see 
   'manual.txt'. Don't forget to replace 'Nodes'
   by 'EDOM' in the uses clause of your units.
   

How to uninstall old components
-------------------------------

1. Choose "Components | Install Packages". 
   A new dialog is launched.
2. Choose the package where you previously 
   installed the components, and open it 
   for modification.
3. Choose 'Node' from the list of installed
   components, and hit the 'remove' button.
4. Hit the 'recompile' button.
5. Close the package window, and next confirm
   that the modifications should be saved. 
6. Remove all files starting with 'Nodes.'
   from the directory where you previously
   extracted the old zip archive.
